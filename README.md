# tk

tk is a game similar to Doom 2, ro wolfenstein 3D.

this project has 2 parts:
- the first one being a game engine so tk could be run, the game engine uses RayCasting in order to deliver the illusion of 3D space
- the second one being the game itself (tk)

tk is a level based game, where you must go through the whole level in order to progress to the next one, though you can think of tk as a game where you must treverse the narrow, but long world, and there are check points along the way.

let me explain:

* Black-> out line of each individual level 
* purple-> doorways / pathways between levels
* while-> the outline of the whole world

*you can treat the game with respect to the black borders (each level).
*or treat it with respect to the white outline (the whole world), an acknowledge that the purple doorways act like checkpoints
